// Imagine you have an NPC called Anna, and your prefix is BB(and, yes, this prefix is taken, too, it's just hypothetical).

// Naturally, make backups before you mass-replace.

She was apparently reviled by her own people for wanting to become a priest, a station reserved exclusively for the men of the village. She harbors no resentment, realizing that her faith must face such tests or be worthless. She traveled the coast, offering her services to local militias, and eventually came into the employ of an adventuring troup in the Nashkel area. Branwen had no idea that the group was participating in banditry, however, and on their first raid she balked at attacking a caravan of unarmed merchants. She rebelled, and a mage named Tranzig turned her to stone in the ensuing fight. Despite the unfavorable outcome, Branwen feels that Tempus views her actions approvingly.

Eventually Branwen and <CHARNAME> would settle down for a time, but some new adventure would always beckon, and, laughing, they would don their traveling garb and take to the road again.
