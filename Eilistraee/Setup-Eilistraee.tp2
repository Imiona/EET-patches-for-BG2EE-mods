SAY @1 /* Sword Dancer of Eilistraee */
SAY @1 /* Sword Dancer of Eilistraee */
SAY @2 /* SWORD DANCER OF EILISTRAEE: Sword Dancers are the servants of the Dark Maiden, Eilistraee. They are usually drow who decided (or were forced to) leave the Underdark. However, not only drow may become Sword Dancers. There are also surface elves and half-elves among them. They usually live in forests or abandoned ruins which become both their shelter and temples. Eilistraee is a good goddess of the moon, dance, song, the sword and the hunt who grants her followers special abilities to help them survive. The Dark Lady herself is a child of Corellon Larethian and Araushnee - later known as Lolth the Queen of the Spider Pits. Eilistraee is also believed to appear in Faerûn herself. At these times, she may be seen during the night as a naked drow woman with long, silver hair, holding a silver sword.

ADVANTAGES:
- May summon a Moon Sword. The enchantment of the sword depends on the Sword Dancer's level.
- May cast Moonfire. This spell grants some light similar to that of the moon. It gives all allies infravision.
- At level 10, the Bladedance skill is granted. It creates a blade that will fight as the caster's ally.
- At level 14, Lesser Spellsong is granted. It gives the caster a Free Action effect.
- At level 16, Spellsong is granted. It gives the caster Free Action as well as Haste.

DISADVANTAGES:
- Only females may become a Sword Dancer.
- Only elves and half-elves may be Sword Dancers.
- Cannot be evil. */

Eilistraee was the daughter of Corellon Larethian and Araushnee, who later became Lolth, and the sister of Vhaeraun. She was banished along with the other drow deities for her role, albeit inadvertently, in the war against the Seldarine. Eilistraee insisted upon this punishment from her reluctant father, because she foresaw that the dark elves would need a beacon of good within their reach.

Eilistraee's allies were the Seldarine, Mystra, Selune and the good deities of the Underdark races; her enemies are the evil deities of the Underdark, especially the rest of the drow pantheon." */

...

The Drow worship the Dark Seldarine, deities that were cast out of the Seldarine after the failed invasion of Arvandor by the Anti-Seldarine. This original trio of gods was joined by four more as time passed. But with the events of the Time of Troubles and the War of the Spider Queen, Lolth subsumed the worship of the entire drow pantheon. 

...

The Time of Troubles, also known as the Arrival, the Godswar and the Avatar Crisis, was a cataclysmic time period in the chronology of Faerûn. Taking place during 1358 DR, the Year of Shadows, the Time of Troubles was a period during which the deities of Faerûn were forced to walk the earth in their mortal avatar forms. Several major deities died during the Time of Troubles and a handful of mortals rose to divinity.

...

Cyric, a petty, sadistic mercenary, slew Bhaal with the sword Godsbane (actually the god Mask in disguise). After the end of the Time of Troubles, he was granted control of nearly all the portfolios of the Dead Three by Ao, making him briefly the most powerful of the gods.

...

The church of Eilistraee headquartered at the Promenade located near Skullport was led by the High Priestess Qilué Veladorn, youngest of the Seven Sisters and Chosen of Mystra. Second to her was the Promenade's Battlemistress Rylla. All priestesses were free to do as they liked unless given a mission by either Qilué or Rylla. Although the Darksong knights, priestess/warriors, had more independence, they too were subject to being given missions. Generally, its clerics wore their hair long and dressed practically for whatever they were currently doing. For rituals, they wore as little as possible. Otherwise, they tended to wear soft leathers for hunting, aprons while cooking, and  rarely  armor when battle was expected. When relaxing, they favored silvery, diaphanous gowns. Their holy symbol was a small sword; clerics preferred holy symbols of silver, typically worn as pins or hung around the neck on slender silver or mithral chains. They prayed for spells at night, after moonrise, singing their prayers whenever possible. Their rituals revolved around a hunt followed by a feast, dancing, and a Circle of Song. This last was held preferably in a wooded glade on a moonlit night, in which the worshippers would sit and dance by turns in a circle, each one leading a song." */
