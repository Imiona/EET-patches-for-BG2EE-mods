REPLACE ~99999~ @84 /* After the victory at the Throne of Bhaal, Isra remained in Tethyr for a time, where she hoped to help repair the damage caused during the Bhaalspawn Crisis. Though she seldom spoke of the uglier aspects of the conflict, those who knew her believed that she felt the need to atone for harm inadvertently committed. This did little to dampen her spirits, however, and she became quite popular amongst the Tethyrian aristocracy... and with one if its minstrels in particular, according to rumor. Nevertheless, her time in Tethyr came to an abrupt end when relations with Amn escalated. Returning north to Crimmor, Isra finally renewed her ties to the Order of the Ruby Rose. Illustrious though her later career proved, no quest could compare to the one undertaken in her youth, and Isra retired from active service at a younger age than she might have otherwise liked. It is said that she eventually went into politics, striving to introduce a bit of compassion into a system sadly devoid of it. She never married, though if Athkatlan gossip can be believed, she seldom suffered from loneliness. */
