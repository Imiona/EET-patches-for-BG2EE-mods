SAY @1 /* SHADOW ADEPT */
SAY @2 /* Shadow Adept */
SAY @3 /* SHADOW ADEPT: These arcane casters are said to be bound to the Shadow Plane. Shadows are both their blessing and their curse. They are able to use a different source of magic--the Shadow Weave--due to a contract made with Shar. Most of them make a special sacrifice to gain access to the Shadow Weave; some are contracted against their will.  It is rumored that some powerful mages are able to use the Shadow Weave without contracting themselves to Shar.

Advantages:

-Gains a +2 thac0 bonus. At level 14 and 21 gets additional +2 thac0 and +0.5 attack per round
-Gains +10% cold resistance and gains an additional 10% every 10 levels
-At level 5 is given permanent Infravision as a result of dealing with shadow-oriented energy
-Has access to a brand new selection of shadow magic spells. Most are similar to their Weave counterparts, but due to springing from a different source, their nature may differ from the spells of Mystra's Weave.
-Once in their lifetime a Shadow Weave Mage may create a black blade that will be usable only by the creator. The power of the blade depends on the level of the Shadow Adept.

Disadvantages:

-Cannot be of any good alignment
-Suffers from -20% fire resistance and -5% resistance to magic fire.
-Cannot learn new spells or use any magic from Mystra's Weave--this includes magical scrolls.
-Suffers -2 caster's level in daylight. At level 14 this penalty is cancelled.


SHADOW WEAVE MAGIC: this new type of magic may be used only by Shadow Adepts, who are mostly servants of Shar. As coldness accompanies Shadow Weave Magic, every spell used by the mage makes cold more difficult for him to resist. Most Shadow Weave spells are more powerful and slightly faster, but Shadow Adepts know a smaller number of spells per level than their Mystra's Weave-using counterparts. */

This first level spell temporarily blinds its target.  A saving throw is allowed, and if successful there are no harmful effects.  If a victim is blinded he receives -4 to hit on his attack rolls, and has a 4 point armor penalty.
The Shadow Weave version of the spell differs slightly--it provides a 5% chance that the target will run in panic.

The armor spell does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, and does not prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration ends.

Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by both normal vision and infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his/her gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.  Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around him such as opening doors, disarming a trap, or opening a chest without becoming visible.  He can, however, cast defensive spells on himself and fellow party members.  If he attacks, he immediately becomes visible, though the invisibility enables him to attack first.
Shadow Magic version of the Invisibility spell provides additional +2 movement rate bonus.

Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting this spell the wizard creates one image of himself that will travel along beside him.  The image will perform all of the actions that the wizard does so that if any enemies are trying to attack the wizard they will not know which one is real.  There is a 50% chance that an attacker will attack the image and a 50% chance that he will attack the caster.  The image will disappear with a successful casting of dispel magic, when attacked, or when the spell duration runs out.
As well as the Reflected Image spell effect, Shadow Twin also provides +5% physical resistance (excluding bludgeoning, as it may "crack the mirror" nature of the spell) and +2 save vs. death.
What is more, there is 30% chance that the spell will act as a Mirror Image spell instead.

The Reflected Image (or Mirror Image) and the caster are both covered with dark gray hues.

Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful bolt of dark energy that inflicts 1d6 points of electric damage per level of the spellcaster (maximum damage of 8d6) +1d12 piercing damage and +2 cold damage to the specific creature targeted. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down).
There is a difference between the Shadow Bolt spell and the more well-known Lightning Bolt spell as the first one hits the target with the whole of its power, which means the bolt itself won't go through the enemy and won't bounce against any surfaces. However, there is a 15% chance that the victim and enemies close to him will be slowed for 10 seconds.

It can also ignite combustible materials (even solid planks). The meteors are treated as missiles hurled by the wizard with a +5 bonus to the attack rolls and with no penalty for range.

The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipients perform any action that cancels it, or until 24 hours have passed.

When this spell is cast, all creatures affected function at double their normal movement rate, gain a -2 initiative bonus, and receive an extra attack each round. Thus, a creature moving at 6 and attacking once per round would move at 12 and attack twice per round. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all ally creatures in a 40-foot cube centered on a point selected by the caster (thus, creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not). Note that affected creatures expend as much energy during this spell as they would normally in a whole day, significantly raising their fatigue level. This spell is not cumulative with itself or with other similar magic. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected. Note that this spell negates the effects of a slow spell.
There is also a 5% chance that the enemies who are in the area will become confused.

If the caster successfully hits with the blade in melee combat, the creature struck suffers 1d4 points of slashing damage, plus an additional 1d2 + 4 points of magic damage +2% chance to cause additional 3 cold damage. However, it is not a magical weapon in the normal sense of the term, so creatures struck only by magical weapons are not harmed by it.

NOTE: This spell uses Shadow Weave Magic that makes the caster more vulnerable to cold.  If this spell is cast, the mage suffers a -8% penalty to cold resistance for 10 seconds. */

Saving Throw: None

When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon himself, an outer skin of shadow will move up from the ground, completely covering him.  This skin is of course magical and will hinder the wizard in no way.  The effect of this is to protect the wizard from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles.  For every 2 levels of the caster an additional skin is gained upon casting; for example a 10th level wizard would receive 5 skins while a 20th level wizard would receive 10.  For each skin the wizard possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against him, but the sixth would affect him normally.  The skins will remain on the wizard until he is affected by dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires.  It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any magical attacks such as Fireball; however, it will protect him from physical magical attacks such as Magic Missile.
While Stoneskin provides gray skin, Shadowskin provides pitch black skin.

When this spell is cast, the wizard is affected with an Improved Invisibility spell and teleported a few feet away from his original position.  Meanwhile, an exact image of the caster is created where he used to be with exactly the same hit points as the caster.  The image cannot perform any actions at all such as attacking or casting spells.  It can, however, move around and act as a decoy for the invisible mage.  The image will remain under the control of the caster until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until it is affected by Dispel Magic or a spell that destroys illusions such as True Sight.

Innate ability
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Self
Saving Throw: None

This spell lets the caster change shape and become a monstrous creature - The Shadowbound. While in this form, the caster becomes immune to: backstab, fear, level drain, confusion, stun, sleep, imprisoment, maze, and wing buffet. The creature is also resistant to most elemental damage: +90% fire and acid, but only +25% cold resistance. The form uses a special weapon that does 1d10+5 and +1d4 cold damage; +6 thac0. Attacks per round are set to 3.
While in this shape, the mage can't cast spells.   

NOTE: This spell uses Shadow Weave Magic that makes the caster more vulnerable to cold.  While in the long term the caster receives a +25% bonus to cold resistance, for the first 10 seconds after the spell is cast the mage suffers a -16% *penalty*. As this spell is a more powerful one, there is a 10% chance that more chill will appear, dealing 1d6 cold damage. */

I let Foundling, the shadow dragon's servant, join my group. He needs to find a special token that belonged to the Shadow Dragon. We should return to the Temple Ruins.~
~Foundling and the Black Curse
We found the special token Foundling was looking for. It doesn't work,and we may need to find an experienced adventurer or merchant who may know something about magical gadgets.~
~Foundling and the Black Curse
We asked Ribald for help and he suggested talking to someone named Gloria. Ribald says she comes in often and should arrive within a few hours.~
~Foundling and the Black Curse
We have spoken to Gloria and she has promised to investigate Foundling's token. She will have information soon and we should meet her at the Adventurer's Mart in one day.~
~Foundling and the Black Curse
Gloria told us what we need to prepare the ritual that may free Foundling. All we need is a specific ritual sword. We should visit the City Gates once we're ready for the adventure.~
~The Colour of Ivory
We met the Ivory Witch who asked us to save her land that has been invaded by a Hag. In return, she will destroy the barrier that is preventing our passage. We are also to place a special seed in the frozen pond that will heal the land.~
~The Colour of Ivory
We did what the Ivory Witch asked us to do and now we can safely travel through the snow-white lands of the Ivory Witch.~
~Foundling and the Black Curse
We found the ritual sword 'Leira's Lie'. Now we need to take the sword to the ruins of Amaunator's temple, to the place the Shadow Dragon died. Foundling will be able to dispel the curse when we arrive.~
~Foundling and the Black Curse
The whole ritual was predicted by the shadow dragon. He returned and possessed Foundling, but we managed to stop him.~

He never tried to see distant lands; he stayed near the lands he had visited with his former leader, but wherever he went, he felt out of place. Some time later, he fell into conflict with followers of Sune, who considered him an abomination shaped by Shar and her dark powers. He tried to escape as he considered the fight pointless, but the group of Sunites followed and caught the lone Shadow Adept. In the ensuing fight he lost one of his hands, denying him the use of most of his Shadow Weave spells. 
		Foundling eventually overcame his maiming, relearned the use of powerful magic with only one hand, and found another group of adventurers to fight with. In time his new band traveled through the Underdark and stumbled upon a settlement of Deep Imaskari that offered him sanctuary--a privilege his adventurer companions were not granted. He left them to find their own destinies, and of his final days nothing is known in the surface world. */

Once, near Trademeet, he encountered a group of knights that chased him for some time and considered him an abomination--nothing more than a cruel shadow creature. The hunt was long and fierce, but after ten days, working together, the group of knights brought down the lone Shadow Adept.
		It was then that Mazzy Fentan appeared and stopped the knights. Foundling, more than surprised, thanked the halfling lady. When asked why she did this, she said "without shadow there is no light," and suggested to the knights that there are more dangerous creatures than this particular Shadow Adept. When she left, Foundling followed her secretly for a time, though what he concluded from his observations is unclear. 
		When he ceased this behavior, after some days of lone wandering, he met a man named Si'iliatrias. This man was a member of the Deep Imaskari, and took Foundling to his homeland beneath the Surface.

He decided to give it a try and studied the creation of magical items and blacksmithing. Foundling created many weapons that could both save lives and kill. He never cared for gold, and his prices weren't high. Once he had sold one hundred different weapons, he is said to have disappeared. But his weapons are still there, in different parts of Faerun.
